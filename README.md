This is a continuation of a small resourcepack originally created by Cituation.
I've used it for quite some time and I like it very much so I've decided to
update it to the newest verions of Minecraft:)

This repo is also a bit of a testing ground for me to play with git tags,
releases and synchronizing releases of software that has to maintain
compatibility with other software (just like mods and resourcepacks with
Minecraft).

Original files has been downloaded from
[Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zrblyv8v1j371pj/Rainbow_XP_Bar_32x.zip/file)
and are kept here in case someone wanted to check if this is the pack they're
looking for and because I like to archive things.
